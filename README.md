# Web Portfolio

## Description
I originally intended on creating my first website, but I was a new self-taught software engineer who didn't have a sense of direction. There were so many different ways I could design my website. I played around with a lot of CSS and JS. It took me hours to create animations and functions that I was satisfied with. In the end, I finally decided to cut down on it to create a simple web portfolio first so that I can continue creating other projects.
